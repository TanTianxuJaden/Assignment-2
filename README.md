Our Assignment 2 main webpage will be filled with multiple quizs on general knowledge. The features in the main webpage is that it shows you your level and the user is able to view his level by clicking the avatar icon.  In each quiz webpage it features a personal leaderboard that can be updated after every attempt (API). Which features the users best score at the top of the leaderboard and specifies which quiz he did for that high score. This is to allow the user to have an overview of how they fare in the quizzes which can help them improve in their future attempts. Each questions is worth 10 points, and in order to up a level user have to hit a 100 points.

Our quizzes will have 10 random general knowledge questions every time the quiz is started. We have a total of 4 quiz on our main webpage, which are quizzes on history, geometry , geography and common knowledge. In each quiz, users would answer all 10 questions and obtain their score after finishing the quiz. The score will automatically be added to users score level. 
 
 Our target audience of our website is mainly for kids aged from 7 - 16. Thus, the reason for our cartoonist design of our website, such as our avatar for users for our website.

# Design process #
We have decided to go with a simple white purple theme with hinges of gray that complements the white in order to not make the website look so plain and empty. This colour scheme is suitable as there isn't anything that can distract users. We have taken inspiration from Kahoot such as the position of where to place the boxes as it is straightforward and easy to locate which box represents which quiz. Our avatar information will be a popup instead of a full page as there won't be full control of customisation of the avatar but instead the avatar simply changes over each level.
