<!--Kawizz-->
Our Assignment 2 main webpage will be filled with multiple quizs on general knowledge. The features in the main webpage is that it shows you your level and the user is able to view his level by clicking the avatar icon.  In each quiz webpage it features a personal leaderboard that can be updated after every attempt. (API) The leaderboard will showcase the scores and timing of each attempt. This is to allow the user to have an overview of how they fare in the quizzes which can help them improve in their future attempts. 

Our quizzes will have 15 random general knowledge questions every time the quiz is started. We have a total of 4 quiz on our main webpage, which are quizzes on history, geometry , geography and common knowledge. In each quiz, users would answer all 15 questions and obtain their score after finishing the quiz. The score will automatically be added to users score level. 
 
 Our target audience of our website is mainly for kids aged from 7 - 16. Thus, the reason for our cartoonist design of our website, such as our avatar for users for our website.
